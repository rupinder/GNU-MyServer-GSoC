---------------------------------------INSTALLATION NOTES---------------------------------------


This software is projected to run under all the version of windows. This software support on windows platform two ways for run: the first like a normal application, the second like a service.
Running like a service is supported onto windows 2000 and XP and give options security and the application can be managed from the service manager; running like a normal application the admin haven't any security and all the contents in the web directory are visible to everyone.
For run myServer like a service we need before to register it, for register it we can run the batch file "REGISTER SERVICE.bat" that register it in the service pool manager. At this point we can start it or from the service control manager or running the batch file "START SERVICE.bat". For stop the service execution you need to run the "STOP SERVICE.bat" file. For easily manage the service you can start the control.exe application that allows with a simple GUI to start and stop myServer.
For run myServer like a normal application you can start the "START CONSOLE.bat", for stop myServer you must press Ctrl+C in the console window.




myServer isn't at a mature status too if you are interested to complete anything in the TODO list please contact me on SourceForge(http://sourceforge.net).
