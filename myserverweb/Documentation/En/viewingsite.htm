<h1 class="title">VIEWING YOUR WEB SITE</h1>
<br />
Once you have your web pages saved in the correct directory you will want to view 
them both on the machine they are saved on and over the Internet. <br />
<br />
To view your files on the local machine type:<br />
<br />
<span class="code">http://localhost</span><br />
<br />
in your web browser's address window.<br />
<br />
To view your files over the internet, you can type your computer's IP
address in any web browser. For example if your IP address is 36.65.34.32 your 
files can be found at:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://36.65.34.32/"><span class="code">http://36.65.34.32</span></a><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">.</span>
 <br />
 <br />
 
<h2 class="title">Using a DNS name</h2>

If you would prefer<span class="code">
http://william.homeip.net</span> instead of your IP address you must get a 
DNS name.<br />

<br />
A DNS name is a network mechanism to assign an IP address a
mnemonic name such as <a href="http://www.google.com/"
 target="_blank">www.google.com</a>. You can get a DNS name using a free 
system like <a href="http://www.DynDNS.org" target="_blank">DynDNS.org</a>.
This service is for PC s with always-on (ADSL, cable,...) connections that 
can be accessed for the better portion of the day.</p>
<p><br />
If you do not have a static IP address, your address changes
every time you connect to internet. But, with a DNS name from
DynDNS.org you are accessible whether your IP address is dynamic
or static.<br />
</p>
<br />
To be sure that your new DNS name refers to your machine every time you
connect to the Internet, you must also install a dynamic DNS
client. You can get a free DNS client at: <a
 href="http://www.directupdate.net/" target="_blank">http://www.directupdate.net</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don&#8217;t like the name <a href="http://myname.homeip.net/"target="_blank">http://myName.homeip.net</a>
but would rather have a name such as <a href="http://www.myname.net/"target="_blank">http://www.myName.net</a>
you need to register a domain through a registrar.
