<h1 class="title">HOW TO USE PERL UNDER MYSERVER</h1>
<br />
<br />
Perl is another widely used scripting language perfect for text
manipulation and web database management.&nbsp; Perl also works with
HTML and XML as well as other markup languages.&nbsp; With Perl's
CGI.pm&nbsp; module, included with the standard distribution, HTML
forms are easily handled.<br />
<br />
In order to use Perl, you must first make sure you have an interpreter.<br />
<br />
GNU/Linux comes with perl already installed. To find out which
directory it is on your system in type:<br />
<p class="code">
type perl</p>
<br />
In order to use Perl in Windows you must first install it.&nbsp; The
interpreter and documentation can be found at the 
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/" target="_blank">Active State Tool Company.</a><br />

<br />
More information and samples of code can be found at The Perl web
site ( <a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_blank">www.perl.org</a>)
or by reading the documentation included with the interpreter. <br />
