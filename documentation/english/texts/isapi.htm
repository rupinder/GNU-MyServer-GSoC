<h1 class="title">ISAPI</h1>
<br />
ISAPI (Internet Server Application Program Interface) is a protocol
used under Windows to run a dynamic application loading an external module 
in the web server process addresses space.
<br />
In order to use ISAPI, you must create a DLL (dynamic link library)
that exports some symbols called by the web server.
<br /> 
<br />
<span class="warning">Warning: If an ISAPI application crashes
it may cause the calling application to fail also so it can be a
MyServer crash cause.</span>
<br />
<br />
If you want to use ISAPI as a self-contained module then you will have
to register an extension, for example .isapi, to be used as an ISAPI
module that is executed directly then you have to use
the <span class="code">EXECUTEISAPI</span> command in the MIME type.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use the ISAPI module to handle all the files for a
specified extension then the command that you will need to use is 
<span class="code">RUNISAPI</span>; doing in this way all the files
with that extension will be handled using the
specified <span class="code">MANAGER</span>.
<br />
<br />
Take a look at the <a href="mimetypes.htm">MIME types
documentation</a> for more information about how extensions are mapped
to MIME types in MyServer.

<br />
<br />
For more information, you can read Microsoft's 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/HTML/_core_isapi_server_extensions_and_filters.asp">ISAPI Overview</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />
It is highly recommended to use this communication protocol if the
ISAPI module is stable and came from a trust-able source, as the module
is loaded directly in the myserver addresses space, it is extremely
fast and without any overhead caused by external process execution.
