@section Directory Listing
When a resource mapped to a local directory is requested, MyServer
shows its content like an usual file manager does.


@subsection Default files
In the @file{myserver.xml} file it is possible to set the default file
to send instead of the directory content.

Default files are defined using the @code{DEFAULT_FILENAME} element
and they are checked in the specified order until one is found.
If a default file can't be found in the directory then its content is
listed.

@example
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.html</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.html</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
@end example

The previous lines define the order of files that are checked by the
web server when a directory is requested.
For example, given the previous configuration and a request to the
@file{http://foo/bar/} resource, where @file{bar/} is mapped to a
local directory, the server will look for these files in order:

@example
http://foo/bar/default.htm
http://foo/bar/index.htm
http://foo/bar/default.html
http://foo/bar/index.html
@end example

If that resources don't exist then the content of @file{bar/} is
listed.

@subsection Directory listing columns
When the directory content is listed, by default MyServer shows the
file name, last modified time and file size.  This default bahaviour
can be changed redefining the @code{http.dir.format} value.

It can be redefined in the local security file, in the virtual host or
in the global server configuration.
Its value is a formatting string, columns are showed in the same order
that they are specified.

@itemize
@item %f
specifies the file name.
@item %t
specifies the file last modified time.
@item %s
specifies the file size.
@end itemize

For example, the @code{%f%s} value displays the file name followed
by its size, while @code{%f%t} displays the file name and its last
modified time.

@subsection Directory listing layout

You can change the layout of the directory browsing page. The line
below, in @file{myserver.xml}, points to the CSS file used to
configure the layout for the browsing directory pages:

@example
<BROWSEFOLDER_CSS>system/folderstyle.css</BROWSEFOLDER_CSS>
@end example
