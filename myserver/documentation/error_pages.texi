@section Error pages
It is possible to specify a page when a HTTP error happens using the
option:

@example
	<DEFINE name="http.use_error_file" value="YES" />
@end example

So, if you set the value to @code{NO}, like in the line below,

@example
	<DEFINE name="http.use_error_file" value="NO" />
@end example

If an error page is not used MyServer will (by default) just send a
header to your browser with the error code.
It is possible to include a HTTP body in the error page, using:

@example
  <DEFINE name="http.error_body" value="YES" />
@end example
