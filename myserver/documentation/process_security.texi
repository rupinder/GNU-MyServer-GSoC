@c -*-texinfo-*-
On POSIX it is possible to change the MyServer process user identifier
and group identifier after it has bound the necessary ports (only the
root user can bind ports < 1024).

To specify a different process user id (PID), you must specify it in
the myserver.xml file as:

@example
<PROCESS_USER_ID>PID</PROCESS_USER_ID>
@end example

Differently, to change the process group id (GID), the configuration
line to use is:

@example
<PROCESS_GROUP_ID>GID</PROCESS_GROUP_ID>
@end example

When one of these features is used, MyServer will not use the
auto-reboot because it will not be possible to get back old
permissions.
