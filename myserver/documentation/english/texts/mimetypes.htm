<h1 class="title">MIME TYPES</h1>
      <p><br />
        <br />
        You can modify the MIME types used by MyServer by modifing the file "MIMEtypes.xml". 
        The following is an example of the .xml file:<br />
        <span class="code">&lt;MIMETYPES&gt;<br />
        -<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MIMETYPE&gt;<br />
        -<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MIMETYPE defaultAction=&quot;DENY&quot;&gt;<br />
        &lt;EXT&gt;htm&lt;/EXT&gt;<br />
        &lt;MIME&gt;text/html&lt;/MIME&gt;<br />
        &lt;CMD&gt;SEND&lt;/CMD&gt;<br />
        &lt;ACTION name=&quot;Host&quot; value=&quot;localhost&quot;&gt;ALLOW&lt;/ACTION&gt; 
        <br />
        &lt;FILTER&gt;gzip&lt;/FILTER&gt;<br />
        &lt;MANAGER&gt;NONE&lt;/MANAGER&gt;<br />
        &lt;/MIMETYPE&gt; <br />
        </span> <br />
        <br />
        Each block describes a different MIME type. <br />
        <br />
        <span class="code">&lt;EXT&gt;</span> is the type of file<br />
        <br />
        <span class="code">&lt;MIME&gt;</span> is the Mime type.<br />
        <br />
        <span class="code">&lt;CMD&gt;</span> is the way to send the file to the 
        client.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="code">&lt;ACTION name=&quot;Host&quot; value=&quot;localhost&quot;&gt;ALLOW&lt;/ACTION&gt; 
        </span> will allow access to the desired MIME Type if the Host is &quot;localhost&quot;. 
        In the line <span class="code">&lt;MIMETYPE defaultAction=&quot;DENY&quot;&gt;</span> 
        we tell that our MIME Type will DNY access from any host we don't set 
        in the proper ACTION tag (so, it will have to exist in the configuration). 
        Also, the property <br />
        <span class="code">defaultAction </span>is optional (when it's omitted, 
        it's set to &quot;ALLOW&quot;). So, in the above example, HTML files will 
        be accessed only through the hostname &quot;localhost&quot;.</p>
      <p>The tag &lt;ACTION&gt; is optional, unless you specify &quot;DENY&quot; 
        for your defaultAction in your MIME Type.<br>
        <br />
        <span class="code">&lt;FILTER&gt;</span> defines a filter for that Mime 
        Type. The data will pass through the filter before being sent to the user. 
        In the example above, the data would be sent gzipped to the user. It means 
        Gzip works as a filter in MyServer. you can define Gzip to automatically 
        run for every file based in its size, setting the &lt;GZIP_THRESHOLD&gt;, 
        in myserver.xml file. For obvious reasons, data will be sent gzipped only 
        if the client supports gzip - otherwise he'd receive a lot of wierd characters 
        instead of the site requested.<br />
        <br />
        In general, filters can also be applied to dynamic data - like CGI, ISAPI, 
        FastCGI - but they need to be filters that don't modify the contents of 
        the page to be shown to the user.<br />
        <br />
        <span class="code">&lt;MANAGER&gt;</span> completes
        the <span class="code">&lt;CMD&gt;</span> command specifying, if
        necessary for the command, an external application to use.<br />
				For example using the RUNCGI command, it will be necessary to specify
        an external process to execute the CGI command, MANAGER under
        GNU/Linux will be something like this:
				<br />
				<span class="code">
				&lt;MANAGER&gt;/usr/bin/php-cgi&lt;/MANAGER&gt;
				</span>
				<br />
				or under Windows:
				<br />
				<span class="code">
				&lt;MANAGER&gt;c:\php\php-cgi.exe&lt;/MANAGER&gt;
				</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The following values for sending the file to the client are valid in the 
        <span class="code">&lt;CMD&gt;</span> section:<br />
      </p>
      <div class="left">
<ol>
  <li><span class="code">SEND</span>
- Send the file statically as
is. &nbsp;This command is used for files extensions such as .html and
.jpg that don't need any external intervention from the web server.</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNCGI</span>
- Run the CGI script
indicated in the path. &nbsp;It is used for file extensions such as
.php and .pl that need to be processed before sending any data to the
client.</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNFASTCGI</span><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"> </span>- Run the Fastcgi script.
&nbsp;This type will need a fastcgi parser downloaded (see the PHP
page).
&nbsp;It is also used for file extensions such as .php and .pl</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTEFASTCGI</span>
- This also runs the
Fastcgi script, but unlike the RUNFASTCGI above, it does not need a
server to run the script, instead it acts as a self server.</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNSCGI</span>
Handle a specified mime type with this SCGI server. </li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTESCGI</span>
Handle the file as a self SCGI process.
	</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNMSCGI</span>- Run the MSCGI script. This library is only available for myServer. 
It is used to build fast and efficient CGIs.</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTE </span>-Treat the file as an
executable and send the output to the client.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="code">SENDLINK</span>
- Send the file that is
contained in a link.</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTEWINCGI</span>
- Send the file as a
WinCGI</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNISAPI</span>
- Run the ISAPI script.
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTEISAPI</span>
- Runs the ISAPI script
but does not need a server to run. Instead, it acts as a self server.</li>
</ol>
</div>
Most applications are already handled in the .xml file.&nbsp; If you
would like to add a MIME type append the file and use the code as an
example.
