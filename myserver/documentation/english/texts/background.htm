<b>MyServer is a powerful web server designed, to be easily run on a
personal computer by the average computer user.<br />  It is based on
multi-threaded architecture, which makes it extremely scalable and
usable in large scale sites, as well as in small networks. It has
built-in supports for the HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols.  <br /> Support
for dynamic pages is made available trough CGI, ISAPI, WinCGI, SCGI
and FastCGI protocols.  <br /> You can share files in minutes.  <br />
<br /> MyServer is available GNU/Linux and other Unix-like operating
systems, as well as Windows.</b>
<br />
<br />
Our principal goal is to create
a <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a></b>
and <b>powerful</b> server, to allow anyone to transform a Personal
Computer into a web server and share web files easily.<br /> MyServer
can also be used professionally due its event driven multi-threaded
architecture and advanced features.
