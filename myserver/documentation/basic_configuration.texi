In the myserver.xml file you can set the default page for your
websites hosted on MyServer.

Similar lines already exist in your configuration file:

@example
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.php</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.php3</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.php</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.php3</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
@end example

In the errors section you learned how to create and use your own error
pages. But you can also disable the custom error pages, by changing
the line below:

@example
<USE_ERROR_FILE>YES</USE_ERROR_FILE>
@end example

So, if you set the value to NO, like in the line below,

@example
<USE_ERROR_FILE>NO</USE_ERROR_FILE>
@end example

MyServer will (by default) just send a header to your browser with the
error code. But you have the option to send a HTTP body included in
the error, by adding this line:

@example
<ERRORS_INCLUDE_BODY>YES</ERRORS_INCLUDE_BODY>
@end example

You can change the layout of the directory browsing page. The line
below, in myserver.xml, points to the CSS file used to configure the
layout for the browsing directory pages:

@example
<BROWSEFOLDER_CSS>system/folderstyle.css</BROWSEFOLDER_CSS>
@end example

CGI Scripts can get the Server Administrator E-mail and show them to
the user (through the SERVER_ADMIN environment variable). So, it can
be important you define this address properly, by setting the value in
the line below, in myserver.xml:

@example
<SERVER_ADMIN>administrator@@localhost</SERVER_ADMIN>
@end example

MyServer offers the feature to follow symlinks on Unix-like Operating
systems (e.g.: Linux, *BSD, GNU/HURD, Solaris, etc.).
You can add the symlink following feature for all hosts in the
myserver.xml file.

@example
<FOLLOW_LINKS>YES</FOLLOW_LINKS>
@end example

The default value used by MyServer is:
@code{<FOLLOW_LINKS>NO</FOLLOW_LINKS>}.
