@section Configuration files
The configuration is done trought three different XML files:

@itemize
@item @file{myserver.xml}
It contains the main myserver configuration.  Almost all settings here
can be redefined locally for virtual hosts or directories.
@item @file{MIMEtypes.xml}
It contains the default MIME types configuration.  It can be redefined
for any virtual host.
@item @file{virtualhosts.xml}
This file defines the different virtual hosts used by MyServer.
Virtual host here is not used properly, as this file is used to define
sites on a protocol different than HTTP/HTTPS where there are not
virtual hosts, for example FTP.
@end itemize

These files can exist in different locations, they are looked in the
following order:
@enumerate
@item Current working directory.
@item Personal directory, ~/.myserver/.
@item Global scope inside /etc/myserver.
@end enumerate

@section Default resource
In the @file{myserver.xml} file it is possible to set the default page
for the sites hosted on MyServer.

Similar lines already exist in your configuration file:

@example
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.php</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.php3</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.php</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>index.php3</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
<DEFAULT_FILENAME>default.htm</DEFAULT_FILENAME>
@end example

The previous line define the order of files to look for when a
directory is requested.  If a default file is not found and the user
has browsing access permissions then the directory contents are
listed.

It is possible to specify a page when a HTTP error happens using the
option:

@example
<USE_ERROR_FILE>YES</USE_ERROR_FILE>
@end example

So, if you set the value to @code{NO}, like in the line below,

@example
<USE_ERROR_FILE>NO</USE_ERROR_FILE>
@end example

If an error page is not used MyServer will (by default) just send a
header to your browser with the error code.
You have the option to send a HTTP body included in the error, by
adding this line:

@example
<ERRORS_INCLUDE_BODY>YES</ERRORS_INCLUDE_BODY>
@end example

You can change the layout of the directory browsing page. The line
below, in @file{myserver.xml}, points to the CSS file used to
configure the layout for the browsing directory pages:

@example
<BROWSEFOLDER_CSS>system/folderstyle.css</BROWSEFOLDER_CSS>
@end example

CGI Scripts can get the Server Administrator E-mail and show them to
the user (through the SERVER_ADMIN environment variable). So, it can
be important you define this address properly, by setting the value in
the line below, in @file{myserver.xml}:

@example
<SERVER_ADMIN>administrator@@localhost</SERVER_ADMIN>
@end example

MyServer offers the feature to follow symlinks on Unix-like Operating
systems (e.g.: Linux, *BSD, GNU/HURD, Solaris, etc.).
You can add the symlink following feature for all hosts in the
@file{myserver.xml} file.

@example
<FOLLOW_LINKS>YES</FOLLOW_LINKS>
@end example

The default value used by MyServer is:
@code{<FOLLOW_LINKS>NO</FOLLOW_LINKS>}.
